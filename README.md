What I did was goto the Windows Command Prompt by hitting the WINDOWS + S keys together to get the Windows Search bar. Then I typed `cmd` and ran the Windows Command Prompt as Administrator. Once the Windows Command Prompt came up then I ran the command `fsutil file createnew forgetsphone.lol [size]`; where size is the number of bytes to fill the file with. We can calculate the file size in bytes like so (1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1) = 1 GiB. That is 1024 Bytes * 1024 Kilobytes * 1024 megabytes = 1 Gigabyte. I ran that command repeatedly for all the remaining space on the C: drive. Once the C: drive was full I then moved to the D: drive by `cd D:` which is change directory to D:. Once moved over I re-ran the fsutil command until all space was filled.

To delete the files, in the same Windows Command Prompt window run `del /f *.lol` which deletes all the lol files from the current folder that you're under.
